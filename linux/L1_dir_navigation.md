## Linux tutorials for switching directories and navigation

- How to navigate to a new directory:
  ```
  pwd
  ls    # lists all the files in the terminal
  cd      ## chnages directory
  ls -a  ## this will view all the files including those that are hidden.
  ls -l  #prints more information of all the files in the directoy.
  ls -la  ## combination of both the above
  ```

- What's relative path and current and parent directory?
  
  ```
  . means current directory 
  .. means parent directory

  cd ../parent_dir/sequece ## this will take you one directory up and then inside of that dir
  ```
